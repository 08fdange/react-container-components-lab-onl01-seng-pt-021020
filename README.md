# React Container Components

## Objectives

1. Explain the difference between container components and dumb components
2. Describe how container components help us move state management to the "edge"
   of the application
3. Practice writing and using container components

## Overview

Here we want students to practice using container components.

This lab can be pretty challenging â€” it's important to give students a big
enough problem that it's clear how managing their applications in this way
helps them reason about and respond to changes in their data predictably.
